  <h2><b><u>Motivation:</u></b></h2>
  <p>Our main motivation for taking on this project was largely due to the interests and hobbies of our group members, the existing research, and to learn more about the effectors of team records in the National Football League. In addition, although sports commentators often comment on predictions for football games, they rarely discuss jet lag as an effector for team performance. Weather is often commented on but not in terms of human physiology and body systems. </p>
  <br>
  <h2><b><u>Data Collection</u></b></h2>
  <p>Data for this project is collected from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/. The data set used in this project is from 2013-2017 regular season for all 32 NFL teams. The distance range is in miles from 0 to 5500 miles. The data has domestic distances within US and there are three international destinations - London, Toronto and Mexico City are included in the data. The performance has many measures. The data was reduced down to 12 statistical categories from nearly 80 in the initial database. Mileage between the cities was calculated using “As the crow flies” distances.</p>
  <h2><b><u>Research Question</u></b></h2>
  <p>The main research question of the project was to analyze the effect of the travel distance on the performance of the football teams. </p>
  <p>Some additional depth questions are:</p>
  <li>What is effect of playing at home vs international?</li>
  <li>What is the impact of mileage traveled on points scored?</li>
  <li>Does travel have a major impact on winning percentage?</li>
  <li>What is the correlation between probability of a win/loss and distance?</li>
  <br>
  <h2><b><u>Hypothesis:</u></b></h2><p> Mileage will have a significant influence on athletic performance by NFL teams.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><b><u>Visualization Design</u></b></h2>
  <p>The aim of the project was to capture this travel distance and performance relation on a map. The first part was to get the US map and get the teams in their home states. To show  interactivity with performance in the time series, first we decided to have a multi line chart. But this was creating confusion. To make it more effective and to have t in a single screenshot., we decided to have US map having teams the travel distances pointing arrows to travel destinations. These arrows are in different colors-green for the winner games and purple what teams lost the game.</p>
  <p>The rough sketch of the first visualization was:</p>

  <h2><b><u>Design Justification</u></b></h2>
  <p>Each of the design elements were carefully considered when making selections. From the type of filters that were employed to the colors of lines, to the display of data, everything was planned to be as accessible as possible for the user. The intention was to have a map and plots that would all be visible without need for scrolling or panning.</p>
  <p>The initial design involved 5 drop down filters, however, they were cumbersome and did not allow for easy manipulation of the map and plots. These were redesigned to be javascript sliders which display the slider values clearly above the axis. The handles were changed from standard squares to the NFL shield for aesthetics. These sliders trigger filtering of the data based on the value when a slide is stopped. This filtered data is then used to update the map and plots instantly to make the user experience as easy as possible. The remaining 2 dropdown menus will be phased out, as the team logos on the map function as team selectors and the eventual plan would be to have 12 small plots in the area at the bottom right of the website where the histogram is, each containing a different statistic. The plots would expand when clicked to view data for the selected statistic. This would allow the website to be used with only the 3 sliders.</p>

  <p>The decision to use a choropleth map was a function of future design possibilities, rather than one of current functionality. Currently, states with NFL teams are highlighted and states without teams are not. Future design possibilities for the map could be adding information about Super Bowl games played in each state to this map. Currently, the data set does not include playoff statistics, so this was not considered in the initial design. The map was designed to have the logos of each team attached to the cities in which they are/were located. There were a couple of unique challenges in this area, as some cities (Los Angeles, New York) have multiple teams and some are in states that could not contain the logo. The decision was made to identify teams in this situation and create a path extending from their city to the logo outside of the map. This meant that a separate file was created to allow for the separation of logos on the map and outside of the map. The lines on the map initially started off as an opaque red, which was quickly recognized as an error, as the map became very confusing and difficult to interpret. The opacity was decreased both to allow the user to see the underlying logos, and to show the density of the number of games played against other teams. Color brewer was used to select colors to depict wins and losses in the arrows. An alternative would have been to use a gradient of a single color to show the team’s winning percentage based on different destinations. I was not able to implement this change, as I would have had to switch from my current data to some form of nested data structure to accomplish this and I was not able to determine a way to accomplish this. A key was added at the bottom left of the map to indicate the meaning of the arrow colors. The arrows and plots are set to display on mouseover for the team logos. This allows more rapid changing of data than a click would. It also allows for the addition of another “onclick” functionality as the project expands.</p>

  <p>The pie chart and histogram were designed to be used in conjunction with each other, as they are displaying the same data in different ways. The pie chart window was designed to identify the team being investigated, a few informational points, and a breakdown of the number of games played in each of the 6 mileage ranges. The colors were selected from color brewer, while the data is technically ordinal, it is also categorical and I believed that the different hues were the optimal way to differentiate between the groups. A key was also added to aid in the understanding of both the pie chart and the histogram below. The histogram was color-coded to match the pie chart to make the user experience easier when looking back and forth between the two plots. The idea behind this would be that if a user was looking at a specific mileage range (3200+ miles for example) and saw that a team had won 100% of their games at that distance, they could easily look above to the pie chart and match the color and see the number of games played in that range. Additionally, the histogram has a horizontal line, marking the selected team’s overall winning percentage for the selected filtered data. This gives the user a quick point of reference to see if a team overperformed or underperformed based on their body of work. The decision here was between adding the line at the 50% mark, which is the league average winning percentage or using the selected team winning percentage. It was determined that because we wanted to compare teams to themselves over different ranges that we should use individual team data. This was particularly effective with teams that had very high or very low winning percentages.</p>

  <h2><b><u>Findings and Reflection</u></b></h2>
  <img src="img/chart.PNG", alt="Chart"></img>
  <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the crossing time zone effect on athletic performance is the influence of the direction of travel. Eastward travel is the most detrimental to performance. This is probably because eastward travel results in a shorter day. Without any environmental cues, the human body adapts a 25-26 hour circadian rhythm. The body is better suited for adapting to a longer day, which results from westward travel, then a shorter day, which results from eastward travel. Sleep medication, such as melatonin, can help remedy jet lag because it provides additional stimuli to coax the circadian rhythm to align with the new time zone. Light exposure in the morning or evening can also help the body ease into the new time zone.</p>
  <img src="img/correlation.PNG", alt="Correlation"></img>
  <p>The correlation matrix above shows the relationships between our independent variables and Mileage. As this project was exploratory in nature, there is less importance on the actual values in comparison to the association. The matrix displays that each of our correlations reflect our hypothesis that athletic performance will decrease as distance increases. Most notable from the table is the correlation from Mileage and Win/Loss shown at the top of the chart. There is a positive correlation with Losses and a negative correlation with Wins. This is in direct agreement with our hypothesis.</p>
  <h2><b><u>Literature Review:</u>Why would travel affect athletic performance?</b></h2>
  <h3><b>Climate Change and Acclimation</b></h3>
  <p>High Heat and humidity cause two main physiological changes in the human body, rise in core body temperature and dehydration. Similarly, “High Heat and Humidity” is relative and based on an individual's perspective (Patriots and Dolphins). Disruption in core body temperature has a adverse affect on a person’s ability to maintain homeostasis (a change in core temperature means the body cannot maintain a normal temperature based on its external environment).  Hyperthermia is the medical term for increases in core body temperature. This has a detrimental effect on muscle endurance (calcium and neurotransmitter synapses) and actually causes changes in metabolic processes in body, transitioning from aerobic systems (krebs cycle and lipid metabolism) to anaerobic systems(fast and slow glycolysis and phosphorylation).</p>
  <p>Anaerobic systems cannot create as much ATP, albeit faster, as the aerobic pathway so this influences the decreases in muscle endurance. In addition, exercise cause the cardiovascular system to vasodilate allow blood and nutrients to flow farther from the hard to facilitate the increase in muscle activity. This causes the stroke volume (how much blood is pumped per beat) of the heart to decrease, limiting the amount of oxygenated blood reaching the outer extremities.</p>
  <p>Cold weather also has a adverse effect on athletic performance. Cold weather has the opposite effect on blood flow as it causes the cardiovascular system to constrict towards the body’s vital organs. This is why fingers and toes are the first victims of frostbite. This process also limits the amount of oxygen that can reach the outer extremities and increases the body’s blood pressure(fewer dilated capillary beds), putting more stress on the heart. The body’s attempt to control this increase in blood pressure is by decreasing Heart Rate. The nervous system also is affected by cold weather inhibiting axon conduction and efficiency of motor junctions.</p>
  <p>An additional study, referenced below, studied how long it takes professional athletes to acclimate to a new climate. The results of the study are staggering and support the results we discovered above. The study revealed that it takes over 14 days to completely acclimate to a new climate. The study measured this by recording several different variables incrementally over two weeks. By the end of the two weeks the variables had not completely returned to baseline values.</p>
  <h3><b>Jet Lag</b></h3>
  <p>According to The National Institute of General Medical Sciences,</p>
  <blockquote>“Circadian rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a daily cycle. They respond primarily to light and darkness in an organism's environment. Sleeping at night and being awake during the day is an example of a light-related circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms are found in most living things, including animals, plants, and many tiny microbes. The study of circadian rhythms is called chronobiology.” - National Institute of General Medical Sciences</blockquote>
  <p>Rapid air travel across several time zones can cause the traveller to experience a change in their internal biological clock. This is called a desynchronisation of the circadian rhythm, or jet lag. Jet Lag disrupts one's perception of time and lasts until the person becomes acclimated to their new environment. According to Circadian rhythms, athletic performance, and jet lag,</p>
  <blockquote>“The most commonly experienced symptoms are sleep disorders, difficulties with concentrating, irritability, depression, fatigue, disorientation, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbance. Apart from the decrements in mental and physical performance directly consequent on such symptoms, competitive athletes are also exposed to the additional negative consequences of a shift from the optimal circadian window of performance.” - Roberto Manfredini and contributing authors</blockquote>
  <p>This supports the findings in our results. As mileage increased, all major indicators for athletic performance (independent variables) supported a decrease in NFL team performance. Further research on Circadian Rhythms may give us more information on the effects it has on professional athletes.</p>
  <h2><b><u>Limitations</u></b></h2>
  <p>The relationship between performance and travel is complex. There are many other intervening variables which are important but not included in the study.  The travel mode, transportation, travel hours, climate /weather during the travel are very important. Limitation- north leads to problems, moving south also causes issues.</p>
  <p>Studies on Major league Baseball players and biological clocks have concluded that sunlight has an effect on the athletes’ perception of time. This could potentially play a role in jet lag for NFL players but it was not able to be examined with the data collected. We expect sample size to be the major difference between the MLB study and ours.</p>
