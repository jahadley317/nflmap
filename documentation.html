  <h2><b><u>Motivation:</u></b></h2>
  <br>
  <p>Our main motivation for taking on this project was largely due to the interests and hobbies of our group members, the existing research, and to learn more about the effectors of team records in the National Football League. In addition, although sports commentators often comment on predictions for football games, they rarely discuss jet lag as an effector for team performance. Weather is often commented on but not in terms of human physiology and body systems. </p>
  <br>
  <h2><b><u>Data Collection</u></b></h2>
  <br>
  <p>Data for this project is collected from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/. The data set used in this project is from 2013-2017 regular season for all 32 NFL teams. The distance range is in miles from 0 to 5500 miles. The data has domestic distances within US and there are three international destinations - London, Toronto and Mexico City are included in the data. The performance has many measures. The data was reduced down to 12 statistical categories from nearly 80 in the initial database. Mileage between the cities was calculated using “As the crow flies” distances.</p>
  <h2><b><u>Research Question</u></b></h2>
  <br>
  <p>The main research question of the project was to analyze the effect of the travel distance on the performance of the football teams. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Some additional depth questions are:</p>
  <li>What is effect of playing at home vs international?</li>
  <li>What is the impact of mileage traveled on points scored?</li>
  <li>Does travel have a major impact on winning percentage?</li>
  <li>What is the correlation between probability of a win/loss and distance?</li>
  <br>
  <h2><b><u>Hypothesis:</u></b></h2><p> Mileage will have a significant influence on athletic performance by NFL teams.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><b><u>Visualization Design</u></b></h2>
  <br>
  <p>The aim of the project was to capture this travel distance and performance relation on a map.
The first part was to get the US map and get the teams in their home states. To show  interactivity with performance in the time series, first we decided to have a multi line chart. But this was creating confusion. To make it more effective and to have t in a single screenshot., we decided to have US map having teams the travel distances pointing arrows to travel destinations. These arrows are in different colors-green for the winner games and purple what teams lost the game.
